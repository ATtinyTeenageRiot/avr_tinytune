<h1>Building the Code and Programming the Chip</h1>

<p>This package contains Atmel Studio 6.2 project files as well as a Makefile for
building the demonstration executable.</p>

<p>This guide is written assuming some experience in working with AVR Microcontrollers and C. Check online for "hello world" style educational tutorials if desired.</p>

<p>Sound output settings can be customized with tinytune/settings.h if you have a different clock speed or wish to change the number of voices/sample rate.</p>

<h2>Running the Demo</h2>

<h3>General Setup</h3>

<p>The demo, tinytune<em>test.c builds several song files, and can be modified to play specific ones by changing the #define test</em>[SONGNAME] line of the file.</p>

<pre><code>// Adding this line should play a bit of music familiar to those who have played
// the NES game Faxanadu, this one is the default for no particular reason.
#define TEST_FAXANADU

// This will play the familiar dungeon theme from the Legend of Zelda.
#define TEST_ZELDA

// And so forth, see tinytune_test.c for more defined songs.
</code></pre>

<h3>Makefile based build, on Linux</h3>

<p>On Debian based distros such as Mint or Ubuntu, the Arduino development package
covers all dependencies, so I recommend installing it if you do not have a dev environment
set up already.</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install arduino
</code></pre>

<p>First, edit the Makefile to specify your MCU programming device, so that <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/avrdude/">AVRDude</a>
can program your chip. Mine's an AVRISP Mkii.</p>

<p>This documentation assumes that you have UDEV set up for non-root access to your programming device. If not, run <em>make program</em>fuses_ and <em>make program</em> with sudo.</p>

<p>There are threads online <a href="http://www.avrfreaks.net/forum/tut-hard-use-avr-dragon-linux-without-being-root?skey=avr%20isp%20udev">documenting this</a> but be aware that UDEV rules have
changed a bit on newer distros.</p>

<p>On Linux Mint 17, I am using this udev rule:</p>

<pre><code>...
</code></pre>

<p>It is likely that it would work on ubuntu as well.</p>

<p>Near the top, find the AVRDUDE_PROGRAMMER definition. E.g.</p>

<pre><code>AVRDUDE_PROGRAMMER = avrisp2
AVRDUDE_PORT = usb
</code></pre>

<p>Change these to match your particular hardware and save. See the <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/avrdude/user-manual/avrdude_4.html">AVRDude documentation</a> for
programmer types.</p>

<p>From the tinytune_test path, run:</p>

<pre><code>make clean&amp;&amp; make program_fuses&amp;&amp; make program
</code></pre>

<p>If all goes well, this should convert the demo songs to code, build the project,
and program the fuses and image onto your device. make program_fuses need only be done
once per chip, unless you've changed the fuse settings. </p>

<p>At this point, your device should also be outputing some sound on Pin 3.</p>

<h3>Atmel Studio 6.2 based build on Windows</h3>

<h4>Prerequisites</h4>

<p>[Atmel Studio 6.2] (http://www.atmel.com/tools/atmelstudio.aspx) must be installed, as well as Python (I'm using 2.7.8, not sure if Python 3.x works).</p>

<p>For the Renoise song importer to work, [Python] (https://www.python.org/download) must be installed and [included in the PATH environment variable for windows] (http://superuser.com/questions/143119/how-to-add-python-to-the-windows-path).</p>

<p>Open tinytune<em>test/tinytune</em>test.atsln in Atmel Studio.</p>

<p>Make sure the build type is set to Release.</p>

<p>Build the project (F7)</p>

<p>Under the Tools menu, open the Device Programming dialog.</p>

<p>Program your device's fuses (optionally), under the Fuses tab.</p>

<p>These are the settings that I'm using:</p>

<pre><code>SELFPRGEN = [ ]
RSTDISBL = [ ]
DWEN = [ ]
SPIEN = [X]
WDTON = [ ]
EESAVE = [ ]
BODLEVEL = DISABLED
CKDIV8 = [ ]
CKOUT = [ ]
SUT_CKSEL = PLLCLK_16KCK_14CK_4MS

EXTENDED = 0xFF (valid)
HIGH = 0xDF (valid)
LOW = 0xD1 (valid)
</code></pre>

<p>The important thing is to have:</p>

<pre><code>SUT_CKSEL = PLLCLK_16KCK_14CK_4MS
</code></pre>

<p>Which enables the 16MHz cpu clock and the fast 64MHz PLL clock.</p>

<p>Continue to the Production File tab on the device programming dialog. Select avr<em>tinytune\tinytune</em>test\Release\tinytune_test.elf and program the device.</p>

<p>At this point, there should be PWM audio playing on Pin 3.</p>
